# intGoL
My goal was to create Conway's Game of Life in ncurses with C. The typical way you'd think to do GoL would be with a 2D array, but that wouldn't be fun, so instead I used an array of integers to store cell state with bits. This project was intended just to find ways to utilise bitwise operations.
